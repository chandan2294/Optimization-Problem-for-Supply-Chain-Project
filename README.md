# Optimization-Problem-for-Supply-Chain-Project


The objective of this porject was to forecast the number of sales given the past data of sales made by an Indian company Dunzo. Given the forecasted sales, build an optimization model that would give us the number of workers required to fulfil the task so that the company doesn't overhire or underhire and make revenue.
